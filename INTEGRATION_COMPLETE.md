# 🎉 Vertical Jump Integration Complete!

## ✅ Integration Summary

The vertical jump functionality from the VertMeasure project has been successfully integrated into the GloSpot app. Here's what has been accomplished:

### 🔧 Technical Integration

1. **Core Files Copied and Adapted:**
   - `vertical_jump/mapping.py` - MediaPipe landmark mappings
   - `vertical_jump/handlers.py` - Pose detection handlers
   - `vertical_jump/calibration_handler.py` - Video analysis logic
   - `vertical_jump/vertical_jump_processor.py` - Main processing class

2. **Backend API Created:**
   - `vertical_jump_backend.py` - Flask server for video processing
   - RESTful API endpoints for video upload, processing, and results
   - CSV export functionality

3. **Frontend Integration:**
   - Added vertical jump test page to the GloSpot app
   - Video upload interface with drag-and-drop support
   - Results display with detailed metrics
   - Integration with existing leaderboard system

4. **Dependencies Managed:**
   - All required Python packages installed in virtual environment
   - MediaPipe, OpenCV, Flask, and other dependencies configured
   - Compatible with Python 3.11 environment

### 🚀 Current Status

**Both servers are running:**
- ✅ GloSpot Frontend: http://localhost:8080
- ✅ Vertical Jump Backend: http://localhost:5001

**All tests passing:**
- ✅ Module imports working
- ✅ Dependencies available
- ✅ Directories created
- ✅ All classes instantiate successfully

### 📱 How to Use

1. **Open the App:**
   - Navigate to http://localhost:8080 in your browser
   - Sign up or sign in to the GloSpot app

2. **Access Vertical Jump Test:**
   - Go to "All Tests" from the bottom navigation
   - Click on the "Vertical Jump" test card

3. **Record and Upload:**
   - Record a video of yourself performing a vertical jump
   - Upload the video using the drag-and-drop interface
   - Enter your name and height for accurate measurement

4. **Get Results:**
   - Wait for AI processing (1-5 minutes)
   - View your vertical jump height and detailed metrics
   - Download CSV results or save to leaderboard

### 🎯 Features Available

- **AI-Powered Analysis:** Uses MediaPipe for pose detection
- **Multiple Metrics:** Jump height, descent speed, descent level, ground time
- **Video Support:** MP4, MOV, AVI, MKV formats
- **Reference Points:** Ground or rim-based measurements
- **CSV Export:** Detailed results download
- **Leaderboard Integration:** Results saved to app's scoring system
- **Responsive Design:** Works on desktop and mobile

### 📊 Technical Details

**Backend Architecture:**

- MediaPipe pose detection
- OpenCV video processing
- Pandas data analysis
- Matplotlib graph generation

**Frontend Integration:**
- Seamless integration with existing GloSpot UI
- Video upload with preview
- Real-time processing status
- Results display with detailed breakdown
- Mobile-responsive design

### 🔧 Maintenance

**To restart the servers:**
```bash
# Backend (in one terminal)
cd /Users/gouthampakala/Desktop/GloSpot
./mp_env/bin/python vertical_jump_backend.py

# Frontend (in another terminal)
cd /Users/gouthampakala/Desktop/GloSpot
python3 server.py
```

**To run tests:**
```bash
cd /Users/gouthampakala/Desktop/GloSpot
./mp_env/bin/python test_vertical_jump_integration.py
```
