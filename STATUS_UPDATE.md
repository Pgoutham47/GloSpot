# 🎉 Vertical Jump Integration - STATUS UPDATE

## ✅ **ISSUE RESOLVED!**

The "Failed to fetch" error has been fixed! Here's what was wrong and how it was resolved:

### 🐛 **Root Cause:**
1. **Matplotlib Threading Issue:** The backend was crashing due to matplotlib trying to create GUI windows in a background thread
2. **Port Conflicts:** Both servers were trying to use ports that were already occupied

### 🔧 **Fixes Applied:**

1. **Fixed Matplotlib Threading:**
   ```python
   import matplotlib
   matplotlib.use('Agg')  # Use non-GUI backend
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   ```

2. **Resolved Port Conflicts:**
   - Killed processes using ports 8080 and 5001
   - Restarted both servers cleanly

### 🚀 **Current Status:**

**✅ Both servers are running successfully:**
- **Frontend:** http://localhost:8080 ✅
- **Backend:** http://localhost:5001 ✅

**✅ All integration tests passing:**
- Backend health check: ✅
- Frontend health check: ✅
- Module imports: ✅
- Dependencies: ✅
